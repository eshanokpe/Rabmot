                            be from a well-known or trusted entity in an attempt to solicit personal information from
                            you. People who send spoof emails may use any information you have provided to
                            commit fraud or possibly identity theft.

                            RABMOT Licensing Agency takes internet security very seriously. Because of the
                            sensitivity of our business, we were able to design our technology and policies to make
                            your online transactions safe, private, and secure. Documented steps are taken to

                                services so that they are accessible to persons with all abilities. Each visitor using this
                                website has the right to obtain information and services independently and

                                We are committed to providing the public, including individuals with disabilities, access
                                to our web-based information and services. This site is designed for viewing in most
                                internet browsers and browser versions to reach the widest audience possible. The

                                However, since the RABMOT portal provides links to many websites that are not
                                created or maintained by us, it is possible that a site reached through our site would
                                not be accessible to persons with disabilities.

                                With high commitment, however, we are making progress toward this goal. How so?
                                We are continually monitoring pages on our site and making necessary modifications to
                                remove accessibility obstacles.

                                breached, create a new password immediately. Do not waste time. <br>
                                <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> Use a unique password. All passwords should be one-of-a-kind and not used on
